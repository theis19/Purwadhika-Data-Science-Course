# Purwadhika-Data-Science-Course
This repository contains my study result and examination answers during my study of Data Science and Machine Learning at Purwadhika Digital Technology School.

The Data Science and Machine Learning course at Purwadhika Digital Technology School consist of three main topics which are as follows:

**1. Python Programming Overview**

This topic discusses about the fundamentals of programming with [Python](https://www.python.org).

**2. Data Science**

This topic discusses about data query, data wrangling, data visualization, data analysis, how to use APIs and dashboard development. There are so many libraries and applications used for this topic. The libraries and applications are listed below.
- [numpy](https://numpy.org)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org)
- [SQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/sql-statements.html)
- [plotly](https://plot.ly/python/reference/)
- [dash](https://dash.plot.ly)
- [tableau](https://www.tableau.com)

**3. Machine Learning**

This topic discusses about the concept of machine learning and it's applications. Similar to the previous topic, there are a lot of libraries used in this topic. The libraries are listed below.
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) used for data preprocessing, data decomposition, predictive analysis, classification, and clustering.
- [Imblearn](https://imbalanced-learn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) used to deal with imbalanced labels in the dataset.

The Data Science and Machine Learning course at Purwadhika Digital Technology School also assigns every student with a final project.
In the final project, students are encouraged to apply the lessons learned during the course as well as exploring other libraries which are used to support the final project.
My final project can be accessed [here](https://github.com/theis19/Sentiment-Analysis-E-Commerce)
